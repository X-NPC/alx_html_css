            <h3>1. Make it obvious</h3>
        </title>
        The first step is to make the cues for your desired habit obvious. This means surrounding yourself with
        reminders of your goal and making it easy to get started. For example, if you want to start exercising, you can
        leave your workout clothes out the night before or put a sticky note on your bathroom mirror.

            <h3>1. Make it attractive</h3>
        </title>
        The next step is to make the behavior itself attractive. This means finding ways to make the habit enjoyable or
        rewarding. For example, if you want to start eating healthier, you can focus on finding healthy foods that you
        actually enjoy.

            <h3>1. Make it easy</h3>
        </title>
        Once you've made the cue and the behavior itself attractive, you need to make it easy to actually do the habit.
        This means removing any obstacles that might get in your way. For example, if you want to start waking up early,
        you can set your alarm clock across the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.

        <title>
            <h3>1. Make it satisfying</h3>
        </title>
        The final step is to make the habit satisfying. This means finding ways to reward yourself for sticking with
        your goal. For example, if you want to start saving money, you can treat yourself to a new outfit after you've
        reached a certain savings goal.

        Clear argues that by following these four steps, you can create new habits that will stick in the long term. He
        also provides a number of tips and tricks for overcoming common challenges, such as procrastination and
        temptation.

        Atomic Habits has been praised for its clear and concise writing style, as well as its actionable advice. The
        book has been a New York Times bestseller and has sold over 5 million copies worldwide.

        In addition to the four-step process, Clear also outlines a number of other principles that can be used to build
        good habits. These include:
    </p>
    <p>
        - The power of habit stacking. This is the idea of attaching a new habit to an existing one. For example, if you
        want to start flossing, you can do it after you brush your teeth.
        - The importance of environment. Your environment can have a big impact on your habits. For example, if you want
        to eat healthier, you can make sure your kitchen is stocked with healthy food.
        - The role of identity. Your identity is the beliefs you have about yourself. If you want to build good habits,
        it's important to believe that you are capable of change.
        - The power of the 10x rule. This is the idea that you can achieve 10 times the results by putting in 10 times the
        effort.
